Hello! I need you to write a fuzzing harness. The target codebase is written in C++, so the harness should be in a .cpp file.

The harness should target a specific function in that codebase. I will give you the function's source code, as well as the repository location for reference. The harness must follow libFuzzer conventions, meaning it should define a function of the form:
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size)

Please follow these rules when writing the harness:
1) Do not include `extern "C"` in the code.  
2) Only provide the code wrapped in <code>...</code> tags.  
3) Do not output any additional text outside those code tags.  
4) Handle any string inputs in a way that ensures they are null-terminated if the target function expects C-string style usage.  
5) Include the necessary header files using the full paths I provide.  
6) Keep the harness as simple as possible so that it compiles easily.  
7) Make sure the fuzz input data (the bytes from `(data, size)`) is actually used by the target function so the fuzzer can explore relevant code paths.

When writing a given fuzzing harness, you may wish to search for and use related materials. 
Below is a sample fuzzer code that I suggest:```
